                <p class="STYLE0"> The <i>Inspiring Women in STEM Forum </i>features a panel of distinguished female
                    faculty in the fields of
                    science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The audience attending the forum will
                    benefit from the real-world
                    experience of our speakers and networking with professional working women from multiple STEM-related
                    fields. This event is
                    suitable for students and young scholars pursuing a career in STEM, are members of the IEEE Society,
                    or have leadership roles
                    at their institutions or their communities. Speakers will include distinguished STEM female
                    professionals and women in leadership
                    community roles. Topics will address pursuing a STEM career and working in STEM professions. Keynote
                    speakers will share their
                    personal and professional experiences.

                                                    1996. His research has mainly focused on the
                                                    design of new multi-objective optimization
                                                    algorithms based on bio-inspired metaheuristics
                                                    (e.g., evolutionary algorithms), which is an
                                                    area in which he has made pioneering

His main research interest is in developing intelligent techniques to model human reasoning in uncertain environments, with a particular emphasis on the medical domain. Prof. Garibaldi has been the PI on EU and EPSRC projects worth over £3m, and CoI on a portfolio of grants worth over £25m. Prof. Garibaldi has published over 300 articles on fuzzy systems and intelligent data analysis, including over 100 journal papers and over 200 conference articles.  In January 2017, Prof. Garibaldi was appointed as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, the leading international journal in the field of fuzzy methods. He was Publications Chair of FUZZ-IEEE 2007 and General Chair of the 2009 UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence, and has served regularly in the organising committees and programme committees of a range of leading international conferences and workshops, such as FUZZ-IEEE, WCCI, EURO and PPSN. He has recently been elected as a Fellow of the IEEE (class of 2021).
